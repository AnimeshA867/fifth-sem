Algorithm for sequential search:
1) Start
2) Read the element from the user.
3) Compare the element with the first element of the array
4) If both the element matches, return "The element has been found" and stop
5) If the elements didn't match, move to the next index of the array and compare.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until the last index of the array or until the element is found.
7) If the element doesn't match and the index is out of bound, return "The element was not found" and stop
