Using Python:
1. Plot the histogram of lenna.jpg. You can use matplotlib library.
2. Generate random NumPy array of size (400,400) in range [0,256) and save it as
image.
3. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Generate 10
different samples from the sine wave at interval of 0.3 starting from 0sec. Plot the
samples against time using python matplotlib.
4. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Generate
samples with sampling rate 2hz starting from 0sec to 10sec and plot the samples
5. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Plot the sine
wave starting from 0sec to 10sec. Consider Nyquist theorem for sampling.
