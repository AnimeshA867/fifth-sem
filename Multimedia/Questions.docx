LAB 1:
Photoshop

2. create an Image with line, rectangle, square and other basic shapes

3. create a new image adding background color and foreground color.

LAB 2:

1) A program to view a BMP file using C or C++ Language:
A Program to produce animation effect of triangle transformation into square and then into circle:

LAB 3:
1. Write a program to read lenna.jpg. Convert it into png and tif. Display disk size of jpg, png, and tif. Display the actual size of jpg without using any library.
2. Write a program to read lenna.jpg and crop width from 100 to 600 and height from 100 to 600 and display the image. Use NumPy library for cropping.
3. Write a program to convert lenna.jpg to gray and binary image. Do not use any library for conversion.

LAB 4:
Using Python:
1. Plot the histogram of lenna.jpg. You can use matplotlib library.
2. Generate random NumPy array of size (400,400) in range [0,256) and save it as image.
3. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Generate 10 different samples from the sine wave at interval of 0.3 starting from 0sec. Plot the samples against time using python matplotlib.
4. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Generate samples with sampling rate 2hz starting from 0sec to 10sec and plot the samples
5. Consider a sine wave with frequency 3hz, amplitude 1 and phase 0. Plot the sine wave starting from 0sec to 10sec. Consider Nyquist theorem for sampling.

LAB 5:
1. Given the wave file, write python program to get different parameters of the wave file such as number of channels, sampling width (bit depth), sampling rate,number of samples. Use wave library. 
2. Let us consider a sine wave with frequency 4400hz, 400m amplitude and phase 0. Generate sample from this sine wave at the rate of 44100hz for 1sec. Save the samples in the form of wave file in python. Use wave library.
3. Implement 1D DCT (discrete cosine transform) in python.
4. Implement run length encoding.
5. Multimedia tools and applications Install following tools and edit different images and video : (a) Swish Max (b) Macromedia Director (c) Morphing Techniques (d) Audio and Video editing software and (e) Data compression

LAB 6:
1. Using Python write a program to justify a text entered by the user on both left-and right-hand side. For example, the test "An architect may have a graphics program to draw an entire building but be interested in only ground floor", can be justified in 30 columns. An architect may have a graphics programs draw an entire building but interested in only ground floor.
2. Write a Huffman Coding in C++.
3. Using Python study the notes of a piano and stimulate them using the keyboard and store them in file.
